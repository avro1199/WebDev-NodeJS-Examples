## Features & Topics Covered

- **Node.js Server Setup**
- **File Uploads with Multer**
- **Parsing and Using JSON Data**
- **Image and Video Uploads to Cloudinary**
- **Form Handling and Validation**
- **PostgreSQL Integration (using pg or Sequelize)**
- **Basic REST API Endpoints**
- **Authentication & Environment Variables (dotenv)**
- **Sample Project Structures**
